//! Real-time per-note voice execution for Corrosion.
//!
//! This module owns the note lifecycle, exciter dispatch, envelope
//! handling, and tail management for a single polyphonic voice.
//! `VoiceManager` (in `manager.rs`) schedules these voices, while
//! `src/lib.rs` forwards host MIDI events and audio-rate parameter
//! snapshots into the voice layer.
//!
//! Each voice pairs a `crate::dsp::ModalResonator` with one of the
//! exciter families exposed by `crate::dsp`, keeping the audio-thread
//! path allocation-free and deterministic.
