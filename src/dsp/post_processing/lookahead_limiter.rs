//! Lookahead peak limiter for the master output stage.
//!
//! `LookaheadLimiter` introduces a fixed delay so it can react to upcoming
//! peaks *before* they reach the output. It computes a gain reduction from
//! the maximum absolute peak in the lookahead window, applies a fast attack
//! and a slower release, and outputs the delayed input scaled by the gain.
//!
//! Compared to the hard `apply_output_limiter` clamp, the lookahead path
//! avoids inter-sample distortion at the cost of `LOOKAHEAD_SAMPLES` of
//! latency (~1 ms at 48 kHz). Allocation-free; ring buffers are fixed-size.

/// Fixed lookahead window in samples. 48 samples ≈ 1 ms at 48 kHz, ≈ 0.5 ms
/// at 96 kHz. Short enough to keep latency negligible for a synth voice;
/// long enough to catch transient peaks ahead of the clip ceiling.
