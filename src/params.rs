//! # Parameter Definitions Module
//!
//! This module defines all user-facing parameters for the Corrosion synthesizer.
//! It provides the bridge between the host DAW (via nih_plug) and the internal
//! DSP algorithms, handling parameter serialization, automation, and UI integration.
//!
//! ## Parameter Categories
//!
//! The 70+ parameters are organized into logical groups:
//!
//! ### Sound Generation
//! - **Exciter** (exciter) - Type of excitation model
//! - **Object** (object) - Resonator object type (Pipe, Plate, Tank, etc.)
//!
//! ### Object Transformations
//! - **Size** (size) - Overall scale of the resonator (0.05x to 10x)
//! - **Rust** (rust) - Corrosion amount affecting high frequencies and decay
//! - **Damage** (damage) - Structural damage introducing rattle and chaos
//!
//! ### Exciter Controls
//! - **Pressure** (exciter_pressure) - Force of excitation
//! - **Speed** (exciter_speed) - Velocity for friction exciters
//! - **Roughness** (exciter_roughness) - Surface texture and grit
//!
//! ### Envelope Generators
//! Standard ADSR for impact/specialty exciters:
//! - **Attack** (env_attack) - Time to reach peak (0.001s - 2s)
//! - **Decay** (env_decay) - Time to reach sustain (0.01s - 5s)
//! - **Sustain** (env_sustain) - Hold level (0.0 - 1.0)
//! - **Release** (env_release) - Time to silence (0.01s - 5s)
//!
//! MSEG (Multistage Envelope) for friction exciters:
//! - **Onset, Attack, Hold, Decay, Sustain, Release** - 6-stage envelope
//! - **Loop Mode** - Off, Forward, PingPong (partial)
//!
//! ### Post-Processing Chain
//! - **Filter** (filter_cutoff, filter_resonance) - Lowpass resonant filter
//! - **Drive** (drive, drive_amount) - Saturation and waveshaping
//! - **Body** (body) - Physical body resonance simulation
//! - **Spread** (width, spread_width) - Stereo width enhancement
//! - **Space** (space_mode, space_amount) - Reverb/echo effects
//!
//! ### Interaction Parameters
//! - **Strike Position** (strike_position) - Where exciter contacts object
//! - **Coupling** (coupling_stiffness) - Bidirectional interaction strength
//! - **Wander** (position_wander) - Simulated hand unsteadiness
//!
//! ## Relationships
//!
//! This module connects to:
//! - `lib.rs` - Parameter values read during audio processing
//! - `voice/mod.rs` - VoiceControls struct bundles parameters for voices
//! - `gui/editor.rs` - Parameters displayed and edited in UI
//! - `presets/mod.rs` - Parameters serialized/deserialized as presets
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! Parameters are accessed via the `CorrosionParams` struct which implements
//! nih_plug's `Params` trait for host integration:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let params = plugin.params();
//! let cutoff = params.filter_cutoff.value();
//! let exciter_type = params.exciter.value();
//! ```
