//! Stiff point scrape exciter.

//! Models a rigid point that catches, bends, and releases as a stiff spring
//! against a moving surface. The math integrates relative motion into a stored
//! deflection term and then converts it back into chatter force.
//! Use it for squeaks, tiny slips, and high-frequency scraping chatter inside
//! the `dsp/exciters` scrape family.
