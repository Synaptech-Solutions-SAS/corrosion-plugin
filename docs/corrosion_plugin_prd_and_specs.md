# Corrosion — Industrial Physical Modeling Synthesizer

## Product Requirements Document and Specification-Driven Development Plan

**Working title:** Corrosion  
**Product type:** VST3 / CLAP software instrument  
**Framework target:** Rust + NIH-plug  
**Primary use case:** Industrial physical modeling synthesis for dark techno, industrial, EBM, dark ambient, cinematic sound design, noise, and experimental electronic music.

---

# 1. Executive Summary

Corrosion is a software synthesizer plugin focused on physically modeled industrial materials and objects. Instead of using traditional oscillators as the primary sound source, Corrosion models the behavior of struck, scraped, bowed, rattled, and vibrated objects such as pipes, plates, tanks, chains, springs, vents, beams, and damaged machinery.

The instrument is designed around a core signal model:

```text
Exciter → Object Model → Modal Resonator Bank → Damage/Corrosion → Body/Space → Output
```

The plugin should feel like a playable factory of resonant material. It should not merely imitate realistic percussion; it should produce believable, physically suggestive industrial sounds that can be pushed into aggressive, unstable, musical, and cinematic territory.

The first production target is a VST3 / CLAP instrument built in Rust using NIH-plug. The MVP should prioritize sound quality, stable real-time performance, simple MIDI playability, and a focused parameter set before adding advanced sequencing, sample import, complex GUI, or effect-mode processing.

# 2. Product Vision

## 2.1 Vision Statement

Corrosion is an industrial material synthesizer: a plugin that lets musicians play, strike, scrape, deform, corrode, and overload virtual physical objects as musical instruments.

## 2.2 Product Positioning

Corrosion is not a general-purpose subtractive synth, wavetable synth, FM synth, or drum sampler. It is a specialized physical-modeling instrument for generating:

- metallic impacts
- pipe basses
- container booms
- rusted resonances
- chain rattles
- bowed steel drones
- industrial percussion
- machine-room atmospheres
- scraped metal tension beds
- unstable damaged-object timbres

## 2.3 One-Sentence Product Description

A physical modeling synth for struck, scraped, corroded, and resonant industrial objects.

## 2.4 Expanded Product Description

Corrosion generates sound from simulated interactions between exciters and resonant objects. A user selects an object, chooses how it is excited, shapes its material properties, adds damage and corrosion, places it inside a resonant body or space, and then plays it via MIDI or triggers it from a DAW sequence.

Where a traditional synthesizer asks the user to choose oscillators, filters, and envelopes, Corrosion asks:

- What object is vibrating?
- What material is it made of?
- How large or tense is it?
- How is it being excited?
- How damaged, rusted, bent, or unstable is it?
- What body or space is resonating around it?

## 3.2 Secondary Users

### Film / Game Composers

Need tension, threat, factory ambience, impacts, and mechanical cues.

### Noise Musicians

Need unstable feedback, harsh resonances, metallic chaos, and controllable aggression.

### Modular Synth Users

Need a software equivalent of physical object excitation, resonators, and damaged materials.

# 4. Product Goals

## 4.1 Functional Goals

1. Generate physically plausible industrial object sounds in real time.
2. Respond to MIDI note input with expressive velocity-sensitive behavior.
3. Expose musically meaningful physical parameters.
4. Support VST3 and CLAP plugin formats.
5. Provide stable low-latency operation in modern DAWs.
6. Provide a focused preset library for immediate usability.
7. Support automation of all major sound parameters.
8. Allow future expansion into sequencer, effect mode, sample exciters, and deeper object modeling.

## 4.2 Sound Design Goals

The plugin must be able to produce:

- tuned pipe hits
- rusted metallic basses
- plate clangs
- oil tank booms
- warehouse impacts
- chain rattles
- industrial hi-hat-like textures
- bowed metal drones
- motor-driven resonances
- scraping metal transitions
- damaged resonant percussion
- dark cinematic metal atmospheres

## 4.3 UX Goals

1. The plugin should be understandable without needing to know DSP terminology.
2. The UI should emphasize physical metaphors: object, material, impact, damage, space.
3. The plugin should expose advanced behavior through macros before exposing technical parameters.
4. Users should be able to generate useful sounds quickly from presets and randomization.
5. The instrument should feel different from a standard subtractive synthesizer.

---

# 5. Non-Goals

The initial product is not intended to be:

1. A fully realistic acoustic simulation engine.
2. A general-purpose polyphonic synthesizer.
3. A sampler or rompler.
4. A full modular environment.
5. A replacement for a complete drum machine.
6. A high-fidelity orchestral physical-modeling instrument.
7. A neural synthesis engine.
8. A plugin host.
9. A DAW.
10. A sample library browser.

The core identity must remain focused: industrial physical modeling.

---

# 6. Competitive / Conceptual Differentiation

## 6.1 Traditional Physical Modeling Synths

Most physical modeling instruments focus on strings, brass, winds, mallets, or acoustic drum behavior. Corrosion focuses on industrial objects and damaged material states.

## 6.2 Traditional Drum Synths

Most drum synths use subtractive synthesis, FM, samples, or noise. Corrosion uses exciter-resonator physical behavior to generate physically suggestive impacts and resonances.

## 6.3 Wavetable / FM Synths

Wavetable and FM synths can produce metallic timbres, but they usually require abstract parameter programming. Corrosion uses object-oriented physical metaphors: pipe, plate, tank, chain, rust, impact, damping, damage.

## 6.4 Sample Libraries

Sample libraries are realistic but static. Corrosion is generative, responsive, tunable, and automatable. Every hit can vary.

## 7.3 DSP Philosophy

The engine should prioritize convincing musical behavior over perfect physics. The initial model should use an exciter-resonator approach with curated modal profiles for different industrial objects.

Full finite-element simulation, computational fluid modeling, and deep physical simulation are out of scope for the MVP.

# 10.3 Modal Resonator Bank

## 10.3.1 Purpose

The modal resonator bank converts excitation energy into object-specific resonances.

Each object profile contains modes:

```text
mode = frequency ratio + gain + decay
```

The note frequency determines the base frequency. Object properties transform mode frequency, gain, decay, and stability.

## 10.3.2 Mode Data Structure

```rust
struct ModeSpec {
    ratio: f32,
    gain: f32,
    decay: f32,
}
```

## 10.3.3 Runtime Mode State

```rust
struct ResonantMode {
    b0: f32,
    a1: f32,
    a2: f32,
    z1: f32,
    z2: f32,
    pan_l: f32,
    pan_r: f32,
}
```

## 10.3.4 Resonator Formula

Use a second-order resonator:

```text
y[n] = b0*x[n] - a1*y[n-1] - a2*y[n-2]
```

Where:

```text
omega = 2πf / sample_rate
r = exp(-1 / (decay_seconds * sample_rate))
a1 = -2r cos(omega)
a2 = r²
```

## 10.3.5 Parameter Transformations

### Size

```text
larger size → lower modal frequencies
```

Implementation:

```text
frequency = base_frequency * ratio / size
```

### Rust

```text
more rust → shorter decay + less high-frequency gain + more noise
```

Implementation:

```text
gain *= max(0, 1 - rust * ratio * high_loss_factor)
decay *= max(min_decay_factor, 1 - rust * decay_loss_factor)
```

### Damage

```text
more damage → detuning + instability + nonlinear buzz
```

Implementation:

```text
ratio *= 1 + random_offset * damage
```

### Material

Material should alter:

- modal distribution
- damping curve
- brightness
- inharmonicity
- stiffness

Material is optional for MVP and required for Version 0.2.

| Stress | 0.0–1.0 | Increases pitch instability under high force |
| Overload | 0.0–1.0 | Adds nonlinear resonator overload |

## 10.4.5 Saturation Formula

Simple MVP formula:

```text
asymmetric = x + damage * asymmetry_amount * x²
output = tanh(asymmetric * drive)
```

Future formula should support selectable nonlinear modes:

- soft saturation
- hard clipping
- wavefolding
- diode-like asymmetry
- transformer-like saturation
- resonator overload

# 13. MIDI Behavior

## 13.1 Note-On

On MIDI note-on:

1. Find inactive voice.
2. If no inactive voice, steal quietest or oldest voice.
3. Convert MIDI note to base frequency.
4. Configure object modal bank.
5. Trigger exciter.
6. Start tail energy tracking.

## 13.2 Note-Off

For percussive hit mode:

- Note-off does not immediately stop audio.
- Resonator tail decays naturally.

For future sustained modes:

- Note-off releases continuous excitation.
- Resonator continues until tail falls below threshold.

## 13.3 Velocity Mapping

Velocity should map to:

| Destination | Mapping |
|---|---|
| Force | Strong |
| Transient brightness | Medium |
| Exciter noise burst | Medium |
| Damage response | Optional weak mapping |
| Output amplitude | Moderate, not exclusive |

Velocity should not merely control loudness.

## 13.4 Aftertouch Mapping

Future default:

| Aftertouch | Destination |
|---|---|
| Channel pressure | Exciter pressure or damage stress |
| Poly pressure | Per-note scrape/bow pressure |

## 13.5 Mod Wheel Mapping

Default:

```text
Mod Wheel → Corrosion Macro
```

Future user-configurable mapping should be supported.

A voice becomes inactive when:

```text
exciter is inactive AND tail_energy < threshold
```

Suggested threshold:

```text
0.00001
```

# 25. Sound Design Specification

## 25.1 Core Sound Identity

The plugin should sound:

- metallic
- physical
- corroded
- heavy
- unstable
- resonant
- industrial
- dark
- percussive
- cinematic

It should avoid sounding:

- clean by default
- EDM-polished by default
- generic analog
- sample-library static
- purely academic
- overly realistic and sterile

## 25.2 Patch Families

### Bass

- pipe bass
- tank sub hit
- damaged metallic low tone
- resonant industrial tom

### Percussion

- plate snare
- chain hat
- pipe rim
- tank kick layer
- beam knock

### Drones

- bowed plate
- motorized pipe
- vent resonance
- warehouse body hum

### Transitions

- scrape rise
- pressure release
- collapsing metal tail
- reverse resonator swell

### Cinematic Impacts

- container slam
- boiler hit
- iron door shock
- underpass impact

# 28. Risks and Mitigations

## 28.1 Risk: DSP Sounds Weak

Mitigation:

- prototype modal profiles offline
- compare object families frequently
- prioritize strong saturation/body behavior
- use sound-design presets early

## 28.2 Risk: CPU Too High

Mitigation:

- fixed maximum mode count
- block-rate parameter updates
- avoid per-sample coefficient recalculation
- reduce voice count initially
- optimize resonator loops

## 28.3 Risk: UI Scope Creep

Mitigation:

- ship generic editor first
- custom GUI only after sound engine works
- keep MVP controls minimal

## 28.4 Risk: Plugin Format Complexity

Mitigation:

- rely on NIH-plug bundling
- test early in REAPER and Bitwig
- keep plugin shell simple

## 28.5 Risk: Physical Modeling Becomes Too Academic

Mitigation:

- judge by musical usefulness
- design presets around real production use
- keep macros expressive and intuitive

---

# 29. Implementation Priorities

## Priority 1 — Sound

The instrument must sound compelling before UI complexity is added.

## Priority 2 — Stability

The plugin must never produce dangerous output, crash under normal DAW use, or allocate in the audio path.

## Priority 3 — Simplicity

The first version must remain focused.

## Priority 4 — Expressiveness

Velocity and automation should change physical behavior, not just volume.

## Priority 5 — Expandability

The architecture should allow new objects, exciters, damage models, and sequencing without rewriting the plugin.

---

# 30. Final MVP Definition

The first complete version of Corrosion should be:

```text
A VST3/CLAP industrial physical modeling instrument with:

- 8-voice polyphony
- MIDI note input
- Hit exciter
- Pipe, Plate, and Tank object models
- Modal resonator bank
- Rust and Damage controls
- Drive and Output controls
- Velocity-sensitive excitation
- Safe output limiter
- Generic or minimal GUI
- 20 factory presets
```

This version is small enough to build but complete enough to validate the product concept.

---

# 31. Future Product Expansion

After the MVP, Corrosion can evolve into a larger ecosystem:

## Corrosion Instrument

Main VST3/CLAP synth.

## Corrosion FX

Audio effect that processes incoming sounds through industrial resonators.

## Corrosion Kits

Expansion preset packs for industrial techno, dark ambient, cinematic impacts, and experimental percussion.

## Corrosion Sequencer

Pattern-based industrial groove engine.

## Corrosion Lab

Standalone sound-design workstation for rendering one-shots, loops, and drones.

---

# 32. Strategic Product Principle

Corrosion should not compete by having the most features.

It should compete by having the clearest sound identity:

```text
physically modeled industrial objects under stress
```

Every feature should reinforce that identity.
