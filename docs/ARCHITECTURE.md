# Corrosion Architecture (current state)

This document describes the **as-built** structure, signal flow, and engineering
contracts of the Corrosion industrial physical-modeling synthesizer. It is
written against the code in `src/` as of 2026-05 and is intended to be accurate
to what actually ships, not to the aspirational DSP described in
`docs/detailed-specs/`. Where the implementation is a deliberate approximation
of a spec, that is called out explicitly.

## 1. Signal Chain

The audio path is a strict per-sample loop inside the host `process()` callback
(`src/lib.rs`). The exciter↔resonator interaction is per-sample by design; the
global post chain is **also** per-sample today (see §9).

### Per-Sample Voice Loop (`Voice::process_sample[_stereo]`)

1. **Render gate** — return early if `!rendering` (idle/decayed voices cost nothing).
2. **Force envelope** — one of three families (see §6): one-shot AR (Hit), ADSR
   (Specialty), or 6-stage MSEG (Friction).
3. **Exciter** — selected model is fed the resonator's current displacement and
   velocity (`get_displacement()` / `get_velocity()`), producing a force.
4. **Resonator** — force is distributed across modes by strike-position
   coefficients and the coupling blend, then each second-order mode is advanced.
5. **Damage rattle** — amplitude-gated noise injected when `damage > 0`.
6. **Velocity highpass boost** — velocity-scaled spectral lift.
7. **Clamp + denormal flush** — output bounded to [-1, 1]; `DENORMAL_FLUSH` trick.
8. **Peak-hold / tail tracking** — drives voice stealing and tail deactivation
   (`TAIL_ENERGY_THRESHOLD = 1e-4`, `TAIL_DEACTIVATE_FRAMES = 4800`).

## 3. Real-Time Safety Contract

The audio callback guarantees:

- **No heap allocation** — verified by `tests/no_alloc.rs`; the non-Windows build
  enables nih_plug's `assert_process_allocs` feature (`Cargo.toml` target cfg).
- **No locks / blocking / I/O / logging** in `process()`.
- **Fixed voice array** — 8 `Voice` instances, each owning all 16 exciter structs
  so dispatch is a `match` on an integer (no trait objects, no allocation).
- **Bounded loops** — modal banks have fixed sizes; MSEG stages are bounded.
- **Denormal protection** — `DENORMAL_FLUSH` add/subtract at the voice boundary;
  resonator coefficients clamp `decay_seconds` to `f32::EPSILON`.
- **NaN/Inf guards** — every voice output is checked with `is_finite()` and
  flushed to zero before leaving the voice.
- **NaN-safe stealing** — non-finite `peak_hold` sorts as the quietest voice
  (`comparable_peak_hold`), so a corrupted voice is reclaimed rather than panicking.

> Caveat: parameter *application* is not control-rate. `lib.rs` calls every
> `post_chain.set_*` setter once per sample, which recomputes coefficients at
> audio rate. This is real-time-*safe* (no allocation) but wasteful, and it is
> the proximate cause of the FactoryReverb delay bug (see `docs/code-review.md`).

## 4. Voice Lifecycle

```text
Idle ──note_on──▶ Active(rendering) ──note_off──▶ Tail(rendering) ──peak<thr for 4800 frames──▶ Idle(!rendering)
                       │                               │
                       └─ steal if pool exhausted      └─ resonator decays naturally; exciter released
```

- **note_on**: snapshot parameters into `VoiceControls`, rebuild the resonator
  via the algorithmic generator configured by the object's character params
  (see §5), configure interaction params, trigger the selected exciter, init the
  envelope. Sets both `active` and `rendering` true.
- **note_off**: clears `active`, releases the exciter and force envelope; the
  resonator tail keeps `rendering` true until it decays.
- **Tail deactivation**: when `!active` and `peak_hold < TAIL_ENERGY_THRESHOLD`
  for `TAIL_DEACTIVATE_FRAMES`, both `active` and `rendering` go false and the
  voice stops costing CPU. (`is_rendering()` is the idle-CPU optimization.)
- **Stealing**: `VoiceManager` prefers an inactive (`!is_rendering`) slot; if none,
  it steals the lowest `peak_hold`, breaking ties toward the oldest `start_frame`.

---

## 5. Resonator Model

`ModalResonator` holds `Vec<SecondOrderMode>`. Each mode is the canonical biquad
resonator:

```text
y[n] = b0·x[n] − a1·y[n-1] − a2·y[n-2]
ω = 2π·f / sample_rate
r = exp(−1 / (decay_seconds · sample_rate))
a1 = −2r·cos(ω),  a2 = r²,  b0 = gain
```

The resonator is built by a single path (algorithmic), then transformed:

- **Algorithmic generator**: each object's `ResonatorAlgorithm`
  (`PipeResonator`, `PlateResonator`, … `IndustrialCogResonator`), configured by
  that object's curated **character** params, generates the modal bank for the
  MIDI pitch.
- **Transform chain**: the generated modes then run the same transforms in order
  (rust → thickness → heat → sludge → damage) plus `res_damping`/`res_brightness`.

Coefficients are cached and rebuilt on sample-rate change. Transformation macros
and character params are applied at note-on and stay fixed for the duration of the
note; the Cable/Sheet **dynamic hooks** are the exception (see below).

> **Approved change (decided 2026-05, implemented 2026-05-27).** The former dual
> path was consolidated: the **algorithmic path is now the only path**,
> `complex_algo` was removed, and a **curated set of 14 per-object "character"
> parameters** is exposed (Pipe Diameter, Plate Aspect/Stiffness, Tank
> Volume/Cavity Mix, Chain Link Mass/Instability, IBeam Shear, Cable Braid/Tension
> Drop, Spring Dispersion/Slosh, Sheet Thinness, Cog Dissonance). Profile tables
> are kept as `mode_count`/budget/test metadata only and no longer drive sound.
> The two generator pitch gaps (Chain ignored the note; Tank's cavity was a fixed
> Hz) are fixed, and the per-sample dynamic hooks (`TautCable` amplitude→pitch,
> `SheetMetal` warp) run in `ModalResonator::process_sample[_stereo]`, scaling each
> mode from its immutable base frequency (allocation-free). The default object
> timbres changed as a result. See `docs/backlog.md` → "Algorithmic resonator
> engine".

Nine object profiles ship: **Pipe, Plate, Tank, Chain, IBeam, TautCable,
CoilSpring, SheetMetal, IndustrialCog**.

---

## 6. Exciter System

Sixteen exciters dispatch by integer (`ExciterType`, IDs 1–16). Each owns its
DSP state and is fed the resonator's contact displacement/velocity each sample so
the interaction is genuinely bidirectional (not feed-through). Families drive the
force-envelope choice:

| Family | Members | Envelope |
|---|---|---|
| Hit | HandStrike, FeltMallet, HardMallet, Drumstick, WireBrush, MetalPipe, MetalChain | one-shot AR |
| Friction | Bow, StiffPoint, HeavyGrinding, CorrugatedDrag, TensionRise | 6-stage MSEG (loopable) |
| Specialty | PneumaticJet, ElectromagneticHum, TensionSnap, ParticleRain | ADSR |

The per-exciter DSP models implement the formulas in
`docs/detailed-specs/exciter-algorithms.md` (Kelvin–Voigt, Hertzian contact,
micro-bouncing, Poisson impulse clusters, Stribeck friction, etc.).

---

## 7. Interaction Bus

`BidirectionalInteractionBus` / `InteractionState` implement the spec in
`docs/detailed-specs/exciter-resonator-interaction.md`:

- Per-mode 1D strike coefficients `c_n(P) = sin((n+1)·π·P)`.
- `fundamental_anchor` clamps `c_0` to a minimum so the pitch never fully nulls.
- `coupling_stiffness` blends feed-forward (`0`) ↔ position-weighted (`1`) force.
- `position_wander` adds a bounded sinusoidal drift to the strike position.
- The resonator reports summed displacement and a first-difference velocity back
  to the exciter each sample.

---

## 8. Transformations

`profile.rs` implements all six transforms from
`docs/detailed-specs/transformation-algorithms.md`, applied to mode specs:

| Transform | Effect (implemented) |
|---|---|
| Size | `f /= scale`, `decay *= scale`, low-mode gain tilt |
| Rust | high-mode-weighted brightness loss + decay loss |
| Thickness | stiffness `√(1 + (t−0.5)·0.15·n²)` raises/inharmonicizes partials |
| Heat | pitch drop (`·(1 − heat·0.05)`) + brightness loss |
| Sludge | mass loading `f·√(1/(1+sludge))` + broadband damping |
| Damage | mode splitting into detuned pairs + amplitude-gated rattle (in the voice) |

Velocity expressiveness (force `V^1.5`, brightness, decay) is applied in the
exciters and envelope velocity response.

---

## 9. Post-Processing Chain

`PostProcessingChain` runs, in order: WDF ladder filter → Lorenz drive →
(Eco bypass) → FEM body → HRTF spread → Space → oversampled clipper. These are
**lightweight, real-time-safe approximations** of the high-fidelity algorithms in
`docs/detailed-specs/post-processing.md`; the module docstrings say as much. See
`docs/code-review.md` §"Post-processing conformance" for the exact gap per stage.

> **Decision (2026-05-28).** The approximations described here are the shipped
> contract. The detailed-specs files are aspirational design notes; promoting
> any single stage to its full PDE/FDTD / HRIR description would be a feature
> proposal, not a finish-the-partial task. The cutoff/drive smoothers added in
> the P1 sweep live inside `WdfLadderFilter` and `LorenzDrive` and ramp at
> audio rate (~20 ms tau) with first-call snap so static-config flows are
> unchanged.

Stage summary (as implemented):

| Stage | Reality |
|---|---|
| WDF ladder filter | 4-pole ladder, soft transistor clip, hash-noise "tolerance" — not a Newton-Raphson WDF circuit |
| Lorenz drive | real Lorenz attractor state used as a mild gain modulator + soft tube curve |
| FEM body | 8 fixed modal resonators — not a finite-element mesh |
| HRTF spread | ≤1 ms delay + 1-pole LP/HP + crossfeed — not HRIR convolution |
| Factory reverb | 4 comb + 2 allpass (Schroeder) — not 3D FDTD |
| Spring reverb | single delay line + 1-pole dispersion — not a helical PDE |
| Factory echo | modulated stereo delay (gentle Doppler-ish) |
| Oversampled clipper | soft diode clip; **the oversample factor is currently a no-op** (see code review) |

### Quality modes (`QualityMode` → `PostQualityMode`)

| Mode | Oversample factor requested | Chain behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Eco | 1× | bypasses FEM body, HRTF spread, and Space |
| Normal (default) | 4× | full chain |
| High | 8× | full chain |
| Render | 16× | full chain |

The mapping is wired end-to-end (param → `set_quality_mode` → `set_oversample_factor`),
and Eco's stage bypass is real and audible. **However the clipper's
oversampling math does not actually oversample** (it zero-order-holds a single
input and averages identical copies), so Normal/High/Render are sonically
identical at the clipper. This is the top defect in `docs/code-review.md`.

### Output protection

Final stage is `apply_output_limiter`: a hard clamp to `±LIMITER_THRESHOLD`
where `LIMITER_THRESHOLD = 0.9661` (≈ **−0.3 dBFS**). The clipper's
`analog_ceiling` parameter defaults to the same 0.9661 and is clamped to
[0.5, 1.0].

## 10. Build, Test, and QA Infrastructure

| Component | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | fmt, clippy (`-D warnings`), no-default-features tests, native gnu lib tests, `render --suite family` smoke, WAV check, `bundle.sh release` |
| `scripts/verify-local.sh` | local mirror of CI |
| `scripts/validate-plugins.sh` | optional `pluginval` + `clap-validator` wrapper |
| `scripts/check_wav.py` / `analyze_wav.py` / `check_clicks.py` | offline artifact validation |
| `benches/performance.rs` | Criterion harness (voice, dense excitation, post chain, idle, offline) |
| `tests/` | integration tests: no_alloc, automation_stress, preset_roundtrip, body, drive, stereo, velocity, chain distinctness, limiter, damage rattle, bow, plugin metrics |
| `src/bin/render.rs` | offline QA renderer incl. `--suite aliasing` → `aliasing_report.txt` |

Default local target is `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` (`.cargo/config.toml`); the
bundle/validator flow uses `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`.

## 12. Known Architectural Decisions & Gaps

- **Per-sample everything.** The exciter↔resonator loop must be per-sample
  (bidirectional coupling). The post chain is also per-sample today, including
  parameter setters — block processing remains a future optimization.
- **All exciters resident per voice.** Trades memory (~all 16 structs × 8 voices)
  for allocation-free, branch-only dispatch.
- **Resonator mode count scales with QualityMode.** Each profile reports a base
  mode count (roughly 6–12); the active QualityMode multiplies that at note-on
  (Eco 0.5× / Normal 1.0× / High 1.5× / Render 2.0×), clamped to ≥1 mode. The
  multiplier is snapshotted into `VoiceControls.mode_count_scale` and only
  re-evaluates on the next note-on.
- **Approximate post DSP.** The post/space/output stages are intentionally
  cheaper than `detailed-specs/post-processing.md`. Treat that spec as a design
  target, not a description of shipped behavior.
- **Oversampled clipper is effectively a soft clipper.** Until the no-op is fixed,
  nonlinear-stage aliasing is unmitigated (and is exactly what the aliasing
  harness measures).
- **Single algorithmic resonator path.** The former dual path was retired
  (implemented 2026-05-27, see §5 and `docs/backlog.md`): `complex_algo` is gone,
  the per-object algorithmic generators are the sole engine, 14 per-object
  character params are exposed, and the profile tables are demoted to
  `mode_count`/budget/test metadata.
